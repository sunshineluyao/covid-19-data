BEL,Belgium - units unclear,2020-07-24,https://epistat.sciensano.be/Data/COVID19BE_tests.csv,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),,146,1183514,102.118,11740,1.013,8630,0.745,Sciensano (Belgian institute for health),https://epistat.wiv-isp.be/covid/,The data is described both as the number of tests performed and as the number of tested patients.,"Sciensano provides a daily time series of the number of tests conducted per day, which is updated retrospectively as new data becomes available each day.

According to the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf), dates for new testing figures correspond to the date of laboratory diagnosis (or when not available, date of sampling). 

It appears that the reported testing figures represent the number of people tested, but this is not entirely clear. The official website describes the testing dataset as the ""Dataset of total number of tests performed by date"", yet the [dataset codebook](https://epistat.sciensano.be/COVID19BE_codebook.pdf) defines the ""tests"" variable as the ""number of tested patients"".

It is also unclear whether the testing figures include technologies other than PCR tests. In a communication on April 3rd 2020, Sciensano indicates that an antigen test made by Coris Bioconcept may now be used for COVID-19 detection. The communication states that positive antigen test results do not have to be confirmed by a PCR test, but that negative or doubtful cases must be confirmed by a PCR test.

Official figures reported in Sciensano's daily epidemiological bulletins do not help to clarify these ambiguities. For example, as of May 10th 2020, the [official time series dataset](https://epistat.sciensano.be/covid/covid19_historicaldata.html) reported a cumulative total of 465,201 tests performed between March 1st and May 9th. However, the epidemiological bulletin for [May 10th 2020](https://covid-19.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/Covid19/COVID-19_Daily%20report_20200510%20-%20FR.pdf) states that 325,796 cumulative tests had been performed by laboratories between the beginning of March and May 9th, while an additional 240,305 tests had been performed through the national testing platform (566,101 total tests).

The bulletin indicates that these figures include both PCR and antigen tests, suggesting that the large discrepancy between the 465,201 figure and the 566,101 figure may be solely due to the fact that the official time series data only includes PCR tests, whereas the official bulletin figures include both PCR and antigen tests. However, it is also possible that the discrepancy is due solely to the fact that the official time series data is reported in terms of ""people tested"", whereas the bulletin figures represent ""tests performed"". We have been unable to find official documentation from Sciensano that resolves these ambiguities."

These report the number and status of confirmed cases, deaths and number of samples tested. This data is available daily from 18th March; reports and infographics prior to this date do not include the number of samples tested. But all figures are dated cumulative since 29th February.

The source reports the number of confirmed ('confirmados') and negative ('descartados') cases, which we sum to get the number of cases tested.

On 24 April 2020, the number of tests suddenly jumped from 23,383 to 45,857, because of what we assume to be the inclusion of rapid tests (""pruebas rápidas""), as made clear by the subsequent infographic published on 27 April. We therefore do not include the 24 April infographic in our time series; and from 27 April onwards, we include only PCR tests.

On 11 May 2020, the Government of Ecuador published a [report](https://www.gestionderiesgos.gob.ec/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/BP-VARIACIONES-INFOGRAFIA-No.-074-11052020.pdf) detailing ""a reclassification of the records by identity card of the persons and not by the number of tests that have been carried out"". This suggests the government is moving towards reporting figures on the number of people tested, where previously they reported the number of cases tested. The reclassification partially explains the fall in the cumulative total after 4 May 2020.

This data does not allow us to publish any cumulative total, since no data is available on how many people had been tested prior to the first week of reporting. However, we integrate this data into our ""daily tests"" time series by dividing each weekly total by 7, thereby estimating the average daily number of people tested.

Our figure for 24 March adds the cumulative number of laboratory tests since 24 February (6,500) to the hospital tests figure (101,046). As such 24 March represents a break in the series.

The report [dated 21 May](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/content/download/254170/2609369) specified a new screening information system (SI-DEP) had been deployed from week 20 (11-17 May) and that epidemiological trends and test positivity rates would be available from 28 May.

However, the number of laboratories reporting data seems to vary from week to week.

The report published on 22nd July states that “from the beginning of the collection up to and including calendar week 29/2020”:
– The cumulative total of samples tested was 7,418,812;
- For calendar week 29 (which ends 19th July), 168 labs reported 531,571 samples tested;
- For calendar week 28 (which ends 12th July), 175 labs reported 504,596 samples tested;
- For calendar week 27 (which ends 5th July), 148 labs reported 500,122 samples tested;
- For calendar week 26 (which ends 28 June), 177 labs reported 462,942 samples tested;
- For calendar week 25 (which ends 21 June), 173 labs reported 384,311 samples tested;
- For calendar week 24 (which ends 14 June), 171 labs reported 325,575 samples tested;
- For calendar week 23 (which ends 7 June), 176 labs reported 340,986 samples tested;

- For calendar week 19 (which ends 10 May), 182 labs reported 403,875 samples tested;
- For calendar week 18 (which ends on 3 May), 175 labs reported 326,788 samples tested;
- For calendar week 17 (which ends on 26 April), 178 labs reported 363,890 samples tested;
- For calendar week 16 (which ends on 19 April), 168 labs reported 331,902 samples tested;
- For calendar week 15 (which ends on 12 April), 164 labs reported 380,197 samples tested;
– For calendar week 14 (which ends on 5 April), 154 labs reported 408,348 samples tested;
– For calendar week 13 (which ends on 29 March), 151 labs reported 361,515 samples tested;
– For calendar week 12 (which ends on 22 March), 152 labs reported 348,619 samples tested;
– For calendar week 11 (which ends on 15 March), 114 labs reported 127,457 samples tested.
– Up to and including calendar week 10 (which ends on 8 March), 90 labs reported 124,716 samples tested.

By subtracting each weekly change from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals by the end of each week.

Since laboratories can post-check the tests of past calendar weeks in the RKI test number query, previous figures may be revised upwards slightly in subsequent reports. The source is explicit that these figures refer to tests performed and that this will not equal the number of people tested, because of multiple tests per person."

Between 10 and 26 May 2020, the reports explicitly include figures for both the number of samples tested and the number of persons tested. Over this period the two figures presented are very close to each other, with the number of persons tested around 0.5% lower than the number of samples tested.

Prior to this period, a single testing figure was provided in each report labeled variously as the number of persons tested, suspected cases tested, samples tested, or without a clear label either way. It is not clear whether this reflects only an inconsistent labelling of a consistent unit of measurement, or whether the reported units were varying in accordance with the provided labels. In either case, the similarity between the number of persons tested and samples tested apparent between 10 and 26 May suggests this issue is unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the series.

For this reason we include all observations prior to 10 May in this series, regardless of the label applied in the report. From the 10 May onwards we use the figures that have been consistently labeled as the number of samples tested."

There is some reason to believe that non-PCR tests are included in the cumulative number of specimens checked to date. [Official COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines](https://covid19.kemkes.go.id/download/Pedoman_Penanganan_Cepat_Medis_dan_Kesehatan_Masyarakat_COVID-19_di_Indonesia.pdf.pdf) published on March 23rd 2020 state that: 

""Handling of COVID-19 in Indonesia uses antibodies and / or antigen Rapid Tests (RT) in case of contact from a positive patient. RT antibodies are also used for case detection...in areas that do not have facilities for RT-PCR inspection. RT antibody examination results are confirmed using RT-PCR."" (translated)

We cannot find explicit confirmation of whether the reported testing figures include or exclude non-PCR tests.

Moreover, it is clear that revisions to past data are simply added to the new cumulative total, making the time series of 'daily tests' very erratic.

This includes three cases where the cumulative number of people tested falls: (1) 19/03; (2) 25/03; and (3) 15/05. For case (1) see footnote 4 which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this. For case (2), we could not find the associated footnote. For case (3), see footnote 3 of the press release which indicates a past mistake has been noticed and the cumulative figure revised on the date to adjust for this.

It isn't clear what exact date these cumulative tests date back to, but it is earlier than 10 Feb when the source reports 938 people had been tested. Prior to the 10 Feb, the press releases provide reports of coronavirus infections for the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama port. We do not report these numbers in the time series as it is unclear how they relate to the cumulative totals.

There appear to be reporting lags, such that the number of labs reporting for days in the current week tend to be lower than for the previous week. As a result, the reported figures are updated retrospectively as additional labs report their results. The figures we display are based on the latest available epidemiological report.

The epidemiological reports state that 'all laboratories in the Netherlands that perform diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 have been asked from 9 March to report these data daily.'

Note that the source states that ""Data for the last few days is incomplete and will be updated in upcoming daily reports"", that the ""Number of tested and proportion of positive findings among the tested is affected by changes in test criteria"".

The sum of this breakdown is lower than the aggregate figure provided. We take this as an indication that the main aggregate figure we report includes all private testing.

The same cumulative figure is published each day by the [National Insitute for Public Health (NIJZ)](https://www.nijz.si/sl/dnevno-spremljanje-okuzb-s-sars-cov-2-covid-19). Here they clarify that figures relate to the number of tests – including those for people who were tested several times.

A footnote states that the figures relate to ""Laboratory tests performed as part of routine testing and the COVID-19 National Survey are included."" The later appears to refer to the prevalence study described on this [Government page](https://www.gov.si/en/news/2020-04-24-national-covid-19-prevalence-survey/). The description of the study states that ""The survey is being conducted on a random sample of 3,000 persons"" and that people will be tested with both a PCR and a serological test. For this reason, the reported testing figures may include serological tests in addition to PCR tests.

The NICD reports the number of 'tests processed', which is also labelled as 'total tested'. On April 18th, the official twitter account for the [Department for Health](https://twitter.com/HealthZA/status/1251605326681575427) clarified that repeat tests for COVID-19 are not counted and that the testing figures refer to the number of people tested.

The NICD began publishing daily updates on 7th February 2020, allowing us to develop a time series from this date forward. We do not know the first date of testing. As of 7th February, 42 people had been tested.

The first estimate in our time series comes from a Ministry of Health press release, quoting Salvador Illa, Minister of Health: ""From the beginning of the crisis and until April 13, the total number of PCR carried out in Spain is 930,230."" The press release is [here](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=detalle&id=4864).

The second is another Ministry of Health press release published on 27 April and relating to testing conducted up to 23 April. It provides a breakdown across Autonomous Communities (regions), with a total for Spain of 1,035,522 PCR tests. The same release provides a figure of 310,038 antibody tests conducted nationwide. These are different to the PCR tests, as we discuss [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing#different-types-of-tests-for-covid-19). Our database aims to not include antibody tests. So in order to provide the data that is most comparable to the other countries in our database, we include only the PCR tests count for this observation.

One aspect of the 27 April press release that is not totally clear is whether the figures provided for each Autonomous Community relate to the 23 April. Comparing the regional breakdowns provided in the Ministry of Health release to those collected from official sources by CIVIO (as of 28 April) suggests that the figure of 203,892 provided for Madrid in the Ministry of Health update—ostensibly dating to the 23 April—may date back to 14 April.

Further data points are collected from the [Ministry of Health's press releases](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/gabinete/notasPrensa.do?metodo=verHistorico) or [its Twitter account](https://twitter.com/sanidadgob).

- Pillar 2: swab (antigen) testing for the wider population.

This new data is available on the [Testing Data in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) page and [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html).

Initially, this data was explicitly described by the CDC as only including viral tests and excluding antibody tests. As recently as [18 May](https://web.archive.org/web/20200518050707/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html) the site stated that 'These data only represent viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data.'

However, as of 26 May, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states – which are aggregated by the CDC – include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests, as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. 

Within this time, the CDC have also changed the way it described the data to be ambiguous as to whether anitbody tests may be included in their figures (see [26 May update](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html)). Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because any antibody tests in the CDC data are not disaggregated, we are unable to exclude them.

No time series is published for this new version of the data. We therefore started collecting on 13 May 2020 the cumulative total of viral tests reported, which is updated daily.

As of [26 May](http://web.archive.org/web/20200526082029/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html), the notes to the data provided by the CDC are limited. They state:

- These data are compiled from a number of sources. Not all tests are reported to CDC.
- The number of positive tests in a state is not equal to the number of cases, as one person may be tested more than once.

The CDC previously published a time series that only covered public health labs and did not include private lab tests, which were occurring in significant numbers. Daily figures were provided since 18 January. This data is still visible on [this page of the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/previous-testing-in-us.html).

The figures for some states appear to include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests.","This is a collaborative project launched in order to fill some of the important gaps in the testing figures being collated by the CDC.

Testing data is gathered from individual states, as reported in state health department websites, data dashboards and press releases from officials.

As of 26 May, there have been a number of media reports noting that the testing figures released by some states include antibody tests in addition to PCR tests – as discussed in [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/05/cdc-and-states-are-misreporting-covid-19-test-data-pennsylvania-georgia-texas/611935/) in The Atlantic. Our dataset aims to report only PCR tests. But because some states do not disaggregate these types of tests we are not currently able to exclude the antibody tests.

Other differences across states include: some report the number of tests performed, others the number of people tested; some include private labs, others not; some report negative test results, others only positive test results; some include pending tests, others do not (below we show figures that exclude explicitly pending results).

Moreover, many states do not explicitly provide details about these important factors needed to interpret the data they provide. 

There are issues in comparing the figures over time. The totals given for early on in the outbreak do not include all states. One significant uncertainty is the extent to which the rapid rise in tests seen from the mid-March in part reflects states beginning to report private lab tests.

Overall the figures should be seen as providing a general indication of testing output, rather than a specific count of a given indicator. Given the very incomplete coverage and reporting delays of the CDC data, it provides a very important additional perspective.

The Project documents their work in lots of detail. See the link provided above for full details."

These figures are also made available on the [Sistema Nacional de Emergencias dashboard](https://www.gub.uy/sistema-nacional-emergencias/pagina-embebida/visualizador-casos-coronavirus-covid-19-uruguay), in which the figures are presented as the number of tests processed since 13 March (""Desde el 13 de marzo se han procesado: [N] test"").

We previously reported testing data from a [dashboard maintained by El Observador](https://observador.cr/covid19-estadisticas/), but on 20 April 2020 we replaced the entire time series based on the reports from the Ministry of Health.

However, based on the context, it is unclear whether this refers to the total number of tests conducted, or number of people who have been tested.","Until the end of April, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health were updating a figure for tests on its disease situation statistics page daily. 

The dashboard referred to its testing data as 'samples tested'. This figure generally matched up to the sum of confirmed cases and negative samples (though there are occasionally some small discrepancies – we report the sum of positive and negative in this case). However, it's unclear whether 'negative samples' includes some instances of resampling for the same person. We therefore cannot say with certainty that these figures are equivalent to the numebr of people tested.

Using web archives we can reconstruct a daily time-series of total samples. These daily updates extend back to 2nd March. We cannot say with certainty when testing began, only that as of 2nd March 1753 samples had been tested. More recently the website stopped updating its testing data, and finally stopped reporting the figures altogether. The last date we were able to collect testing data was on the 29th April.

The reported figures include positive, negative, and pending test results.

The press release for May 6th 2020 reported that 7,808 PCR and 8,244 ""rapid screening"" tests had been conducted to date. We exclude rapid screening tests from the daily time series that we construct, since we assume that these are antibody tests.

Prior to May 6th 2020, the press releases either: (a) reported a combined cumulative total of PCR and rapid screening tests without providing a breakdown between the two types of tests; or (b) did not clearly specify whether the reported cumulative total was in reference to PCR tests, antibody tests, or both. For this reason, the daily time series we construct begins on May 6th 2020, at which point the press releases began to clearly indicate that the reported cumulative totals only include PCR tests.
